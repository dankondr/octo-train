## About

This project provides you with comfortable interface for developing your programming skills with CodeForces and Project Euler üéâ

## Install

```bash
$ pip install octo-train
```

## Usage

```bash
$ octo-train
```

### Creating new user

On first launch application will ask you to provide some info.

#### Name

Just your name to get personalized experience. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

#### CodeForces level

To start your CodeForces journey with octo-train you must specify level of problems you can solve.

You can either specify 0 and start from the easiest ones (you can change it in the settings later) or go to codeforces/archive and find appropriate level for you.


>‚ö†Ô∏è Problems level is the number specified on the right from problem's name. It starts at 500 and goes up to 3000 with step of 100.

#### CodeForces daily goal

The minimal number of problems you want to solve every day.

#### Project Euler level

With Project Euler you must specify level of problems you can solve too.

You can either specify 0 and start from the easiest ones (you can change it in the settings later) or go to projecteuler/archives and find appropriate level for you.


>‚ö†Ô∏è Problems level is the orange bar on the right from problem's name. Hover to see the number. It starts at 5% and goes up to 100%.
